# The mimetype filter file used by mimetype filter plugin.

# This filter can be configured to work in one of two modes (similar to ones in suffix-url-filter)
# default to reject ('-')

# default to reject ('-'): in this mode, only documents with a mimetype that match the ones
# specified in the config file will be accepted, all other URLs will be
# rejected.
# default to accept ('+'): in this mode, only documents with a mimetype that match the ones
# specified in the config file will be rejected, all other URLs will be
# accepted.
#
# The format of this config file is one URL suffix per line, with no preceding
# whitespace. Order, in which suffixes are specified, doesn't matter. Blank
# lines and comments (#) are allowed.
